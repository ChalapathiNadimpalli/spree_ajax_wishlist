SpreeAjaxWishlist
=================

Enables ajax based wishlist functionality.

## Installation

1. Add this extension to your Gemfile with this line:
  ```ruby
  gem 'spree_ajax_wishlist', github: 'ChalapathiNadimpalli/spree_ajax_wishlist', branch: '3-1-stable'
  ```

  The `branch` option is important: it must match the version of Spree you're using.
  For example, use `3-1-stable` if you're using Spree `3-1-stable` or any `3.1.x` version.

2. Install the gem using Bundler:
  ```ruby
  bundle install
  ```

3. Copy & run migrations
  ```ruby
  bundle exec rails g spree_ajax_wishlist:install
  ```

4. Restart your server

  If your server was running, restart it so that it can find the assets properly.
